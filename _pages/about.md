I am an Associate Professor of Management and Organizational Behavior at [EM Normandie Business School](https://en.em-normandie.com/) in France. I am also responsible for leading the graduate program in Digital Strategy and Innovation. Additionally, I have the honor of serving as the Senior Editor of [Career Development International](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/cdi), contributing to the advancement of career research.

My research journey began with a focus on virtual teams and remote work, exploring the behavioral processes and organizational outcomes linked to digitalization. However, as my career progressed, I found myself delving into more profound questions within the field of social and organizational psychology. My interests extended to the metascientific properties of the organizational psychology field, where I aim to address issues related to inequalities in research, the dominance of the scientific elite, and the challenges faced by academia and academics.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Work and Organizational Psychology from [Tilburg University]( https://tilburguniversity.edu) in the Netherlands. I also hold graduate degrees from [Vrije Universiteit Brussel]( https://vub.ac.be), [DePaul University Chicago](https://kellstadt.depaul.edu), and [Northumbria University]( https://northumbria.ac.uk). Recently, I finished another graduate degree, specializing in Higher Education Policy, at the [University of Illinois â€“ Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).
