I am an Associate Professor of Management and Organizational Behavior at [EM Normandie Business School](https://en.em-normandie.com/) in France. I am also responsible for leading the graduate program in Digital Strategy and Innovation. Since January 2023, I have been serving as the Senior Editor of [Career Development International](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/cdi), contributing to the advancement of career research.

During my doctoral research, I focused primarily on virtual teams and remote work, exploring the behavioral processes and organizational outcomes associated with digitalization. Simultaneously, I was keen on delving into the impact and darker aspects of digital media usage in broader social settings, ranging from education to dating. However, as my career progressed, I found myself drawn to more profound questions within the field of psychology and social sciences in general. My interests expanded to critical perspectives in the organizational psychology field, where I aim to address issues related to research inequalities, the dominance of the scientific elite, the sustainability of academic careers, and the challenges faced by academics. In addition to my scholarly research, I recently started writing on topics around science (mostly social sciences), the science of science (meso- and meta-science), and the lack of science (research ethics).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Work and Organizational Psychology from [Tilburg University]( https://tilburguniversity.edu) in the Netherlands. Recently, I finished a graduate degree in Higher Education Policy at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I also hold graduate degrees from [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://vub.ac.be), [DePaul University Chicago](https://kellstadt.depaul.edu), and [Northumbria University]( https://northumbria.ac.uk) and an undergraduate degree from [the University of London](https://london.ac.uk).
